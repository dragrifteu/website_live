It recalled a history when people who were different were often confined to circuses. Yet within the harsh conditions of nomadic circus life, many found a form of validation, as other options were often denied to them.<br><br>This edition gathered an impressive number of performers from across four countries. For the first time in Dragrift’s history, we moved away from the concept of a post-runway afterparty – instead, we hosted the legendary Budapest circuit party Triton. With international gogo dancers, top Hungarian drag queens, and legendary DJ Chris Dustin, Triton also brought a major prize: the chance for the winner of Dragrift to perform at two large queer events in Budapest.<br><br>Freaky Cirque also became a subject of artistic exploration. A filmmaker shot footage for an upcoming documentary, a photographer used Dragrift as the basis for her bachelor’s project, and designers showcased their creativity through drag queens on the runway. The visual output of Dragrift lived on beyond the night itself – exhibited in installations, vernissages, and even published in photo books by participating photographers. This time, the event was covered by four photographers and three content creators – fulfilling the dream of turning Dragrift into real work opportunities for queer people.<br><br>We also continued the tradition of non-competitive performances – the night was opened by Madrid in collaboration with Slovak vogue mother Monika Prikkelová and her students. The closing act was a surprise prepared for Pandora: Spizy G and the Slayground crew delivered a full show to her debut single Viper Hiss, with the choreography precisely recreated from the music video. The performance left Pandora – and the entire audience – completely breathless.<br><br>For the first time, we also introduced VIP tables, provided catering for the performers, and sent complimentary tickets to every Slovak queer organization as a thank-you for their years of work. Additionally, we partnered with Dom svetla to support a prevention campaign against the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.<br><br>When it comes to atmosphere, Freaky Cirque joined Pride and the Major Vogue Ball as one of the milestone events of the year that bring full-scale queer festival energy to Bratislava.<br>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7" style="line-height: 2.3;"><b>Slovak Dragrift was no longer a whisper of activism – the theme itself became a scream.</b> As a response to the worsening political climate in Slovakia and the attempt of extremists to claim “traditional Slovak culture” as their own, the chosen theme gave every performer space to present their national heritage through the colors of their identity.
						<br><br>For the very first time, the evening opened with a tradition-setting <b>opening performance by Madrid</b>, which framed the narrative and emotional energy of the night. Another milestone was the introduction of <b>unique, custom-designed Dragrift trophies</b> — original sculptures created exclusively for the winners. The Slovak edition also marked the beginning of new collaborations, including <b>Humanic</b> and the art design book series <b>“AHA” by graphic artist Tomáš Kompaník.</b>
						<br><br>The night unfolded as an opulent celebration of folklore, surrealism and identity — a reclamation of cultural roots and a reminder that <i>our heritage belongs to us as well</i>. Many attendees arrived wearing <b>traditional Slovak folk garments taken from their family wardrobes</b>, bringing generational symbols to a queer space. It became a shared gesture of pride and continuity — a way to claim home without asking for permission.
						<br><br>At a time when a large part of the queer community in Slovakia feels that the political far-right is trying to take away their sense of belonging, this evening transformed into something more than entertainment: it became a cultural statement, a love letter to our roots, and a declaration that <b>Slovak queer identity is real, alive and here to stay</b>.
						<br><br>The judging panel featured Slovak actress <b>Kristína Kanátová</b>, set designer <b>Rasťo Matys</b>, fashion designer <b>Sarkis Gazaryan</b>, and — for the first time — <b>Spizy G</b>, who officially became Dragrift’s first permanent judge. The evening was hosted by <b>Ivinitty</b>, with music by ballroom <b>DJ Zolthanos</b>, <b>Queen Kar´Ma</b>, and an electrifying afterparty by <b>Spacer</b> and <b>Bali G.</b><br><br>

Dragrift also took an intentional step in embedding meaning directly into the program – lipsync songs carried queer history and context, bringing a broader societal layer to the night.<br><br>A new special category, Queen of the Night, was introduced, awarding winners with opportunities such as bookings and gigs on other queer platforms.<br><br>For the very first time, Dragrift also gained international reach – filmmakers from Brussels attended the event to document the night and portray the life of the queer community in Slovakia. The project was created in collaboration with “the father of Dragrift,” Madrid, who at that time was also interning at the Citizens’ Panel in Brussels alongside organizing Dragrift.<br><br>The evening was hosted by Ivinitty, with DJ Enby setting the mood on the runway and DJ Noona firing up the afterparty.<br>

The vibe was just as wild, but the categories shifted to reflect the night’s spirit, with a brand-new Pride category added to celebrate Pride Month.<br><br>The judging panel once again included Lady Vivian, joined by the uncompromising Rasťo Matys. The extra special guest judge was makeup artist and influencer Milan WTF – the very first celebrity judge in Dragrift’s history, kicking off the tradition of guest stars on the panel. The party was once more fueled by DJ Noona and Queen Karma, who kept the tropical energy alive all night.<br><br></p>

The vibe was just as wild, but the categories shifted to reflect the night’s spirit, with a brand-new Pride category added to celebrate Pride Month.<br><br>The judging panel once again included Lady Vivian, joined by the uncompromising Rasťo Matys. The extra special guest judge was makeup artist and influencer Milan WTF – the very first celebrity judge in Dragrift’s history, kicking off the tradition of guest stars on the panel. The party was once more fueled by DJ Noona and Queen Karma, who kept the tropical energy alive all night.<br><br>An unforgettable highlight came with the Pride category, where each performer carried themselves with such love and pride that the judges couldn’t do anything but award everyone the maximum score.<br><br>
